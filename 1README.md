# E-VOTING-SYSTEM

What is E-Voting?
Electronic voting (also known as e-voting) is voting that uses electronic means to
either aid or take care of casting and counting votes. A worthy e-voting system 
must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established
by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements
associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, 
cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.
